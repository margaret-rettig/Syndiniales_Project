# Code used to filter a 6 million sequence data set into a 1.5 million sequence data set pertaining to target organism (Syndiniales parasites)
# and then visualize the spatiotemporal diveristy of the marine microbial community in the North Pacific.

# The included code generates a cleaned data set containing sequences belonging to the Syndinales, an order of parasitic dinoflagalletes, as well as 
# a variety of analyses in both graphical and stasitcal formats that illustrate the variation of the North Pacific Syndiniales community.
